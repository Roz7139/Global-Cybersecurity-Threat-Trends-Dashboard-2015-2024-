# Global Cybersecurity Threat Trends â€“ Insights & Analysis (2015â€“2024)

This document summarizes key findings and strategic takeaways derived from the Tableau dashboard analyzing global cybersecurity threat data from 2015 to 2024.

---

## 1. Attack Growth Over Time

- Cyberattacks have grown **steadily since 2015**, with peaks around **2022â€“2023**.
- This trend reflects rising global digitization, especially during and after the pandemic.

---

## 2. Geographical Risk Distribution

- Countries like the **UK, Brazil, India, Japan, and France** experienced the highest volume of attacks.
- **USA, China, Russia, and India** reported the highest financial losses.

> **Insight**: Both digital infrastructure and data sensitivity correlate with attack risk â€” mature and emerging economies alike are targets.

---

## 3. Industry-Specific Impact

- The **IT sector** saw the highest number of affected users, followed by **banking**, **healthcare**, and **education**.
- These sectors often store **personal or financial data**, making them highly valuable targets.

> **Insight**: Industry-specific defenses are critical â€” one-size-fits-all protection is not sufficient.

---

## 4. Attack Methods

- **DDoS, Phishing**, and **SQL Injection** were the most common attack types.
- DDoS had the widest reach, while phishing remains dangerous due to its low barrier to execution.

> **Insight**: Awareness training and email filtering remain crucial defenses across industries.

---

## 5. Attack Origins (Source)

- **Nation-state** and **insider threats** account for nearly **50%** of all attacks.
- **Hacker groups** and **unknown sources** make up the remainder, suggesting both organized and opportunistic behaviors.

> **Insight**: Threat modeling should explicitly consider internal and state-sponsored risks â€” not just anonymous hackers.

---

## 6. Exploited Vulnerabilities

- **Social engineering** and **unpatched software** are nearly tied as the most exploited weaknesses.
- Also notable: **weak passwords** and **zero-day vulnerabilities**.

> **Insight**: Human behavior and technical debt are equally dangerous. Continuous patching and employee education must go hand in hand.

---

## 7. Incident Resolution Performance

- The average resolution time for incidents is **36 hours**.
- The average resolution time did not show much improvement since 2015.

> **Insight**: Organizations should pair incident response speed with **proactive threat detection** to minimize both duration and impact.
